This is the paper of csbs which is under cse department .Our faculty Manasi De Maam was same teacher for both the section .This set has a level order traversal of binary search tree(bst),here we have to find the sum and difference of the tree .
The second question tests knowlege of stack operation (push & pop ) also there are concepts of reversing an array & apply bubble sort and finding an sorted array.
This set is a personal favourite as i got it my end sem practical exams .
